# React - Todo Sagas

My go to React app boilerplate with `react-redux` and `redux-saga`. Written as if freshly scaffold with infinitered `ignite` andross biolerplate, but for the web. Complete with example of asynchronous programming using the `yield` keyword and function generators for a responsive, and fully RESTful Single Page App experience. Has basic development workflow gooies like hot module replacement and state persistance across code reload. There's also a `json-server` web services mock for blackbox testing.

# Todo (from official docs)

A better redux pattern for a basic Todo app using the command-line tool `create-react-app`. This repo was used as part of a training series on `react` and `react-redux`.

# Dating Service

Challenge here was to fork a boilerplate and provide a solution as if for a client. Leveraging `react-redux` pattern containers for higher-order components, and pure components for presentation. As well as selector pattern for flexible state shapes.
